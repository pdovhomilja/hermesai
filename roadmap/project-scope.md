# IALchemist.app - Project Scope Analysis

*Senior Architecture Analysis - Date: August 15, 2025*

## Executive Summary

IALchemist.app is an AI-powered application designed to enable users to communicate with Hermes Trismegistus, the legendary figure of Hermeticism and alchemy. The project aims to create an immersive digital experience that combines ancient wisdom with modern AI technology.

## Current State Analysis

### Technical Foundation
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.6 with React 19.1.0
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS
- **Status**: Fresh Next.js boilerplate - no custom implementation yet
- **Architecture**: App Router pattern (modern Next.js structure)

### Project Maturity
- **Phase**: Initial setup/scaffolding
- **Code Base**: Default Next.js template with basic configuration
- **Customization**: Minimal (CLAUDE.md and project naming only)

## Vision & Objectives

### Primary Vision

   - Shared wisdom collections
   - Study groups and circles

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router
2. **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude API
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for user data/chat history
4. **Authentication**: NextAuth.js or Clerk
5. **Deployment**: Vercel (optimized for Next.js)

### Performance Requirements
- **Page Load**: < 2 seconds initial load
- **AI Response**: < 3 seconds for typical queries
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent users

### Security & Compliance
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Secure API key management
- User data encryption
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
