## Phase [X] Requirements
[Paste the specific phase requirements from the phase file here]

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
1. **TypeScript First**: All code must be TypeScript with proper type safety
2. **Functional Programming**: Use functional patterns, avoid classes where possible
3. **Component Structure**: Follow the established pattern:
```

- Exported component
- Subcomponents
- Helper functions
- Static content
- Type definitions

```
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with proper logging
5. **Performance**: Optimize for Core Web Vitals, use React Server Components when possible

### File Naming Conventions
- **Directories**: lowercase with dashes (e.g., `spiritual-guidance`)
- **Components**: PascalCase files with kebab-case directories
- **API Routes**: lowercase with descriptive names
- **Utilities**: camelCase functions in kebab-case files

### Database Considerations
- All database operations must use Prisma
- Include proper indexing for performance
- Use transactions for multi-table operations
- Consider data retention and privacy requirements

### Security Requirements
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Use CSRF protection where needed
- Sanitize user content appropriately
- Follow secure coding practices

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Add component tests for complex UI logic
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Specific Implementation Tasks

### Step 1: Environment Setup
[Detail environment variables, dependencies, and configuration needed]

### Step 2: Database Changes
[Detail Prisma schema changes, migrations, and data seeding if needed]

### Step 3: Core Implementation
[Break down the main implementation into logical steps]

### Step 4: API Development
[Detail API endpoints, their schemas, and business logic]

### Step 5: Frontend Implementation
[Detail UI components, state management, and user interactions]

### Step 6: Integration & Testing
[Detail how components integrate and testing approach]

## Critical Success Factors

### Must-Have Features
- [List essential features that must work perfectly]

### Performance Targets
- API responses < 200ms (excluding AI generation)
- Page loads < 2 seconds
- Core Web Vitals in green
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Error Scenarios to Handle
- Network failures
- Database connectivity issues
- AI API rate limits
- Invalid user inputs
- Authentication failures

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Before Implementation
- [ ] Read and understand the complete phase requirements
- [ ] Review previous phases for context and dependencies
- [ ] Understand the overall architecture and patterns
- [ ] Identify potential integration points

### During Implementation
- [ ] Write type-safe TypeScript code
- [ ] Follow established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Write unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios

### After Implementation
- [ ] Run `pnpm lint` and fix all issues
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` and fix all build errors
- [ ] Test all new functionality manually
- [ ] Verify integration with existing features
- [ ] Check responsive design on mobile/desktop
- [ ] Validate accessibility requirements
- [ ] Review security implications

## Example Implementation Flow

### 1. Analysis Phase (10 minutes)
- Review the phase requirements thoroughly
- Identify dependencies on previous phases
- Plan the implementation approach
- Identify potential challenges

### 2. Setup Phase (15 minutes)
- Install required dependencies
- Update environment variables
- Create necessary database migrations
- Set up basic file structure

### 3. Core Development (60-90 minutes)
- Implement core functionality step by step
- Write tests as you go
- Handle errors appropriately
- Follow TypeScript best practices

### 4. Integration Phase (20 minutes)
- Integrate with existing systems
- Test API endpoints
- Verify UI components work correctly
- Check responsive design

### 5. Quality Assurance (15 minutes)
- Run linting and fix issues
- Run build and fix any errors
- Manual testing of key functionality
- Final code review

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Issues
- Forgetting to handle loading states
- Not implementing proper error boundaries
- Missing TypeScript types or using `any`
- Ignoring accessibility requirements
- Poor performance optimization

### Integration Issues
- Breaking existing functionality
- Not following established patterns
- Missing authentication checks
- Incorrect database relationships
- Improper state management

### User Experience Issues
- Poor mobile responsiveness
- Confusing navigation or UI
- Missing loading indicators
- Unclear error messages
- Inconsistent styling
