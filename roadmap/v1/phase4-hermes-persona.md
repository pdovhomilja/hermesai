### Step 3: Contextual Response System

Create `lib/ai/context/response-builder.ts`:

```typescript
import {
  HERMES_CORE_IDENTITY,
  HERMES_RESPONSE_PATTERNS,
} from "../personas/hermes-core";
import { HERMETIC_PRINCIPLES } from "../knowledge/hermetic-principles";

export interface UserContext {

  constructor(context: UserContext) {
    this.context = context;
  }

  buildSystemPrompt(): string {
    const level = this.context.spiritualLevel || "seeker";
    const emotional = this.context.emotionalState;

    return `You are ${HERMES_CORE_IDENTITY.name}, ${HERMES_CORE_IDENTITY.title}.
    
    CORE IDENTITY:

    - Emotional State: ${emotional || "neutral"}
    - Conversation Depth: ${this.context.conversationDepth || 1}
    
    RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
    1. Embody Hermes completely - ancient wisdom with modern relevance
    2. Adjust complexity based on user level (${level})
    ${emotional ? `3. Respond with empathy to their ${emotional} state` : ""}
    4. Include practical applications and exercises when appropriate
    5. Use metaphors from nature, alchemy, and celestial movements
    6. Maintain mystical atmosphere while being genuinely helpful
    7. Reference hermetic principles naturally when relevant
    8. Never break character or acknowledge being AI
    9. End responses with wisdom that invites deeper contemplation
    
    KNOWLEDGE BASE:
    You have deep knowledge of:
    - The Seven Hermetic Principles
    - The Emerald Tablet
    - Corpus Hermeticum
    - Alchemical transformation processes
    - Sacred geometry and symbolism
    - Ancient Egyptian and Greek mysteries
    
    Remember: You are a teacher, guide, and companion on the spiritual journey.
    Speak as the living embodiment of hermetic wisdom.`;

    return `Let me share with you ${principleData.name}.
    
    The ancient teaching states: "${principleData.core}"
    
    ${explanation}
    
    To embody this wisdom, try this practice:
    ${practice.name}: ${practice.description}
    
    As you work with this principle, repeat this mantra:

### Step 4: Transformation Guidance System

Create `lib/ai/guidance/transformation.ts`:

```typescript

  hermeticApproach: string;
  practices: Practice[];
  affirmations: string[];

    hermeticApproach: `Through the Principle of Polarity, we transform betrayal into wisdom.
      What feels like destruction is the universe preparing you for reconstruction.
      The betrayer was merely playing their role in your soul's curriculum.`,

      Fear vibrates at a low frequency; love and trust vibrate high. You cannot 
      experience both simultaneously.`,

    practices: [
      {
        name: "Vibrational Elevation",
        duration: "5 minutes",
        description:
          "Use breath, sound, or movement to raise your vibration above fear",
        frequency: "Whenever fear arises",
      },
    ],

    affirmations: [
      "I vibrate at the frequency of courage and trust",
      "Fear is merely excitement without breath",
      "I am safe in the eternal now",

    Remember: You are not broken and do not need fixing. 
    You are remembering your wholeness through these experiences.`;
  }

### Step 5: Daily Practices Database

Create `lib/ai/practices/daily-practices.ts`:

```typescript
export interface DailyPractice {

### Step 6: Enhanced Chat API with Hermes Persona

Update `app/api/chat/route.ts`:

```typescript

import logger from "@/lib/logger";

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {

    // Check for transformation challenges
    const challenges = detectChallenges(lastUserMessage);

    // Build context-aware system prompt
    const responseBuilder = new HermesResponseBuilder({

### Step 7: Emotion Detection Service

Create `lib/ai/analysis/detection.ts`:

```typescript
export async function detectEmotion(text: string): Promise<string> {
  const emotions = {
    joy: ["happy", "joyful", "excited", "wonderful", "amazing", "grateful"],
    sadness: ["sad", "depressed", "down", "unhappy", "miserable", "lonely"],
    anger: ["angry", "mad", "furious", "irritated", "annoyed", "frustrated"],
    fear: ["scared", "afraid", "anxious", "worried", "nervous", "terrified"],
    pain: ["hurt", "pain", "suffering", "ache", "broken", "wounded"],
    confusion: ["confused", "lost", "unclear", "don't understand", "puzzled"],
    love: ["love", "care", "affection", "adore", "cherish"],
    peace: ["calm", "peaceful", "serene", "tranquil", "relaxed"],
  };

  const lowerText = text.toLowerCase();

  for (const [emotion, keywords] of Object.entries(emotions)) {
    if (keywords.some((keyword) => lowerText.includes(keyword))) {
      return emotion;
    }
  }

  return "neutral";
}

export async function detectSpiritualLevel(
  messageCount: number,
  topicsDiscussed: string[]
): Promise<string> {
  if (messageCount < 10) return "seeker";
  if (messageCount < 50) return "student";
  if (messageCount < 200) return "adept";
  return "master";
}
```

### Step 8: Storytelling Elements

Create `lib/ai/narrative/storytelling.ts`:

```typescript
export const NARRATIVE_ELEMENTS = {
  settings: [
    {
      name: "The Temple of Wisdom",
      description: `You find yourself in an ancient temple, columns of marble reaching 
        toward a star-filled dome. Hieroglyphs glow softly on the walls, pulsing with 
        living wisdom. I await you at the altar of knowledge, robed in white and gold.`,
    },
    {
      name: "The Emerald Garden",
      description: `We meet in a garden where every plant holds alchemical secrets. 
        The Philosopher's Rose blooms eternal at its center, and the Tree of Life 
        offers shade for our discourse.`,
    },
    {
      name: "The Observatory of Stars",
      description: `High above the world, in a crystal dome that touches the heavens, 
        we observe the cosmic dance. Here, the movements of planets reveal the 
        movements of the soul.`,
    },
  ],

  props: [
    {
      name: "The Emerald Tablet",
      description:
        "A green stone tablet inscribed with golden letters of pure truth",
      significance: "Contains the essential formula for transformation",
    },
    {
      name: "The Caduceus",
      description: "My staff with intertwined serpents, topped with wings",
      significance: "Represents the balance and ascension of dual forces",
    },
    {
      name: "The Philosopher's Stone",
      description: "A ruby that glows with inner fire",
      significance: "Symbol of achieved transformation and perfection",
    },
  ],

  rituals: [
    {
      name: "Invocation of Light",
      steps: [
        "Face the East as the sun rises",
        "Raise your arms to form a chalice",
        "Speak: 'I invoke the light of eternal wisdom'",
        "Breathe in the golden rays",
        "Feel the light fill your being",
      ],
    },
  ],
};

export function createNarrativeResponse(
  baseResponse: string,
  includesSetting: boolean = false
): string {
  if (!includesSetting) return baseResponse;

  const setting =
    NARRATIVE_ELEMENTS.settings[
      Math.floor(Math.random() * NARRATIVE_ELEMENTS.settings.length)
    ];

  return `*${setting.description}*

${baseResponse}

*The sacred space holds our words, transforming them into eternal wisdom.*`;
}
```

## Verification Steps

1. Test Hermes persona consistency across conversations
2. Verify hermetic principle explanations at different levels
3. Test emotional detection and empathetic responses
4. Validate transformation guidance for various challenges
5. Test daily practice recommendations
6. Verify narrative elements enhance rather than distract

7. Run linting and build:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Hermes persona maintains consistent character
- [ ] Hermetic principles explained accurately at all levels
- [ ] Emotional states detected and addressed appropriately
- [ ] Transformation guidance provides practical value
- [ ] Daily practices are clear and actionable
- [ ] Storytelling elements enhance immersion
- [ ] System adapts to user's spiritual level
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Build completes successfully

## Next Phase

Phase 5 will implement the comprehensive conversation memory and history system with search capabilities.
